## Slide 1: Title + Hook (30 seconds)

### Visual: Nx logo on dark background (gear + lightning bolt)

"Today I’m showing you Nx — a powerful build system for modern JavaScript monorepos.
It helps teams develop, test, and scale multiple apps and libraries — all in one workspace."

## Slide 2: THE PROBLEM (40 seconds)

### Visual: Screenshot or code snippet showing multiple separate repos

"As projects grow, teams hit these issues:"

1. Duplication Everywhere – Same configs, scripts, linting rules

2. Slow CI/CD – Everything builds and tests on every push

3. Hard to share code – Reusing utils between apps is painful

4. Inconsistent Tooling – Different teams, different setups

We need structure and efficiency — that’s where Nx comes in.

## Slide 3: WHAT IS NX? (50 seconds)

### Visual: Diagram — one Nx workspace containing multiple apps + libs

"Nx is a smart build system and monorepo manager for JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Angular, Node, and more."

1. Monorepo Management — Multiple apps, one toolchain
2. Dependency Graph — Nx understands what depends on what
3. Incremental Builds — Rebuilds only what changed
4. Plugin Ecosystem — React, Next.js, Express, NestJS, etc.

## Slide 4: LIVE DEMO (90 seconds)

## Slide 5: COMPARISONS & WHEN TO USE (60 seconds)

**vs Lerna**: Nx adds caching, graph analysis, and generators.
**vs Turborepo**: Nx has deeper integrations and better dev tooling.

**Use Nx when:**

- You manage multiple apps/libraries

- You need shared code and consistent tooling

- You want fast CI/CD with smart rebuilds

**Skip Nx if:**

- You have a single small app

- You don’t share code across projects

## Slide 6: CONCLUSION (30 seconds)

### Visual: Nx logo + “Smart Monorepos, Fast Builds”

"Nx brings order and speed to complex JavaScript ecosystems."
Mock less, build faster — with a single source of truth for your workspace.

- Scales teams and projects
- Speeds up builds
- Standardizes workflows
