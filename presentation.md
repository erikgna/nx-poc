## Slide 1: Title + Hook (30 seconds)

### Visual: Nx logo on dark background (gear + lightning bolt)

"Today I'm showing you Nx — a powerful build system that transforms how teams manage JavaScript monorepos."

"It helps you develop, test, and scale multiple apps and libraries — all in one unified workspace."

"Let's see why thousands of teams switched to Nx."

## Slide 2: THE PROBLEM (45 seconds)

### Visual: Split screen showing chaos vs order (multiple scattered repos → one organized workspace)

"As projects grow, engineering teams face critical challenges:"

### The Four Pain Points:

**1. Configuration Hell** — Every repo has duplicate configs, scripts, and linting rules

**2. Slow CI/CD Pipelines** — Everything rebuilds and retests on every push, wasting time and money

**3. Code Sharing Nightmare** — Reusing utilities between apps requires publishing packages or copy-paste

**4. Tooling Inconsistency** — Different teams use different setups, making collaboration difficult

"Teams waste hours on these problems. Nx solves all of them."

## Slide 3: WHAT IS NX? (50 seconds)

### Visual: Architectural diagram showing one Nx workspace with multiple apps + shared libs

"Nx is a next-generation build system designed for modern JavaScript and TypeScript development."

### Four Core Capabilities:

**1. Unified Monorepo** — Multiple apps and libraries, single toolchain and configuration

**2. Smart Dependency Graph** — Nx automatically maps what depends on what across your entire codebase

**3. Intelligent Caching** — Never rebuild or retest unchanged code, locally or in CI/CD

**4. Rich Plugin Ecosystem** — First-class support for React, Next.js, Angular, Express, NestJS, and more

"Let me show you how this works in practice."

## Slide 4: LIVE DEMO (90 seconds)

## Slide 5: WHEN TO USE NX (50 seconds)

### Visual: Decision tree or comparison table

"Is Nx right for your team? Here's how to decide."

### Nx Excels When You:

✅ Manage **multiple related applications** (web app + mobile + admin dashboard)

✅ Need **shared code** across projects (design system, utilities, API clients)

✅ Want **fast CI/CD** with smart caching and incremental builds

✅ Require **consistent tooling** across teams and projects

### Skip Nx If You:

❌ Have a **single small application** with no plans to expand

❌ Don't need to **share code** between projects

❌ Work **solo** on simple projects

### Quick Comparison:

- **vs Lerna:** Nx adds computation caching and task orchestration
- **vs Turborepo:** Nx offers richer IDE integration and code generation

"For scaling teams, Nx is the industry standard."

## Slide 6: CONCLUSION + CALL TO ACTION (25 seconds)

### Visual: Nx logo + tagline: "Build Smart. Scale Fast."

✅ **Scales teams and codebases** — From startup to enterprise

✅ **Speeds up development** — Caching cuts build times by 10x

✅ **Standardizes workflows** — One toolchain, consistent experience
